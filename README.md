This is an experiment building a toy SwiftUI app with [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) and [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift).

To run it locally:

1. Install [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise).
2. Install [Tuist](https://tuist.io) using mise. See [the installation instructions](https://docs.tuist.io/guide/introduction/installation.html).
3. In your local copy of the repo, on the command line, run `tuist install` to install the dependencies.
4. Then run `tuist generate`. Xcode will open with the workspace ready to go.
